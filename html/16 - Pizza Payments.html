    <p>
      Kate and Michael want to buy a pizza and share it. Depending on the price of the pizza, they are going to divide
      the costs:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>If the pizza is less than €5,- Michael invites Kate, so Michael pays the full price.</li>
      <li>
        Otherwise Kate will contribute 1/3 of the price, but no more than €10 (she's broke :-) and Michael pays the
        rest.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      How much is Michael going to pay? Calculate the amount with two decimals, if necessary.
    </p>
    <script>
      function michaelPays(costs) {
        if (costs < 5) return +costs.toFixed(2);
        if ((1 / 3) * costs > 10) return +(costs - 10).toFixed(2);
        return +((2 / 3) * costs).toFixed(2);
      }
      console.log(michaelPays(6.75));
