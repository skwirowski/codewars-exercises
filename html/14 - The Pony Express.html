      <b>A History Lesson</b>
      <br />
      The Pony Express was a mail service operating in the US in 1859-60. It reduced the time for messages to travel
      between the Atlantic and Pacific coasts to about 10 days, before it was made obsolete by the transcontinental
      telegraph.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>How it worked</b>
      <br />
      There were a number of stations, where:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The rider switched to a fresh horse and carried on, or</li>
      <li>The mail bag was handed over to the next rider</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b>Kata Task</b>
      <br />
      stations is a list/array of distances (miles) from one station to the next along the Pony Express route.
      <br />
      Implement the riders method/function, to return how many riders are necessary to get the mail from one end to the
      other.
    </p>
    <p><b>NOTE:</b> Each rider travels as far as he can, but never more than 100 miles.</p>

          distance += stations[i];

            counter += 1;
            distance = stations[i];
