    <title>Cat and Mouse - Easy Version</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      You will be given a string (x) featuring a cat 'C' and a mouse 'm'. The rest of the string will be made up of '.'.
      <br />
      <br />
      You need to find out if the cat can catch the mouse from it's current position. The cat can jump over three
      characters. So:
      <br />
      <br />
      C.....m returns 'Escaped!' <-- more than three characters between
      <br />
      <br />
      C...m returns 'Caught!' <-- as there are three characters between the two, the cat can jump.
    </p>

    <script>
      function catMouse(x) {
        const regExp = /[.]/g;
        return (x.match(regExp) || []).length <= 3 ? 'Caught!' : 'Escaped!';
      }
      console.log(catMouse(''));
    </script>
  </body>
