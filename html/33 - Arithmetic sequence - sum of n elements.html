    <title>Arithmetic sequence - sum of n elements</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <p>
      In your class, you have started lessons about "arithmetic progression". Because you are also a programmer, you
      have decided to write a function.
    </p>

    <p>
      This function, arithmetic_sequence_sum(a, r, n), should return the sum of the first (n) elements of a sequence in
      which each element is the sum of the given integer (a), and a number of occurences of the given integer (r), based
      on the element's position within the sequence.
    </p>

    <p>For example:</p>

    <p>arithmetic_sequence_sum(2, 3, 5) should return 40:</p>

    <pre>
    1     2        3          4            5
    a + (a+r) + (a+r+r) + (a+r+r+r) + (a+r+r+r+r) 
    2 + (2+3) + (2+3+3) + (2+3+3+3) + (2+3+3+3+3) = 40
  </pre

      // This is my recursive approach version of this kata
      // Arithmetic progression general formula an = a1 + (n - 1) * r

      function ArithmeticSequenceSum(a, r, n, sum = 0) {
        if (n <= 0) {
          return sum;
        }

        sum += a + (n - 1) * r;

        return ArithmeticSequenceSum(a, r, n - 1, sum);
      }

      console.log(ArithmeticSequenceSum(2, 3, 5));

      // This is my loop approach version of this kata

      /*
        function ArithmeticSequenceSum(a, r, n) {
          let sequenceSum = 0;

          for (let i = 1; i <= n; i += 1) {
            sequenceSum += a + (i - 1) * r;
          }

          return sequenceSum;
        }
